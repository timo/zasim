This is zasim, a python package for simulating and experimenting with
cellular automata.

Get an overview from docs/index.rst, generate a html documentation using
sphinx either from tox with tox -e docs or with "make html" from the docs
subfolder.

Visit the homepage of zasim at http://zasim.wakelift.de/, which is basically
just the generated html documentation put up on a webserver.

In order to get a complete documentation, you still need to generate the logo
image from the svg using inkscape with the following commands:

# create the compilation animation picture like this:
inkscape -f docs/logo.svg -i snake -j -C -e zasim/idle.png
# create the logo for the documentation with this command:
inkscape -e docs/_templates/logo.png -C -w 175 -h 175 docs/logo.svg
