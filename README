This is zasim, a python package for simulating and experimenting with
cellular automata.

After installing, run

    zasim_cli --help

or

    zasim_gui --help

for a quick overview of what zasim has to offer.

Look at docs/tutorial/installation.rst for help on installation or read
docs/tutorial/invocation.rst for info on how to use zasim.

Get an overview from docs/index.rst, generate a html documentation using
sphinx either from tox with

    tox -e docs

or with

    cd docs
    make html


Visit the homepage of zasim at http://zasim.wakelift.de/, which is basically
just the generated html documentation put up on a webserver.
