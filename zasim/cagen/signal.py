"""This module implements a Computation that handles signal passing between
cells.

A signal is defined as a payload with a direction and each cell has a field
that defines what direction the cell will read from next.

Before the computation, the signal that is sent to this cell is retrieved and
the local variables signal and signal_dir are set.

If there was no signal, both variables will be set to None.

Setting the out_signal and out_signal_dir variables will send a new signal, but
setting a new out signal when signal_receive_ok was not True will cause signal
loss.""" # XXX this is out of date
