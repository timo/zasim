"""==============================
Branded IPython Notebook Launcher
=================================

Executing this module will create an overlay over ipython notebooks own static
files and templates and overrides static files and templates and copies over all
example notebooks into a temporary folder and launches the ipython notebook server.

You can use this to offer an interactive tutorial for your library/framework/...


To use this script properly, create three folders in the same folder this script
resides in:

    parent
    |
    +- this_script.py
    |
    +- templates/
    |  |
    |  ...
    |
    +- static/
    |  |
    |  ...
    |
    |+ notebooks/
    |  |
    |  ...


The folders templates and static may be empty, but must exist. Read the
docstring of merge_dirs to find out how these folders are treated.

If you put those folders anywhere else, change the variables in the
Configuration section below.

In your setup.py you can add the following to your entry_points:

      [console_scripts]
      my_framework_tutorial = framework.examples.notebooks.this_script:launch_notebook_server

and a binary will be created for the user's system that launches this script.

Additionally, add these package_data entries, so that the static files
get installed, too:

      package_data = {
          'framework.examples.notebooks':
              ['notebooks/*', 'static/**/*', 'templates/*'],
          }
