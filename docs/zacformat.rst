:mod:`zasim.zacformat` - text_to_cell Interop
=============================================

`Text to Cell <http://github.com/timo/text_to_cell/>`_ is a piece of Software
developed by Tobias Maier. It takes a high-level description of a cellular
automaton as input and outputs different formats. One of them is made for
interoperability with zasim. It can be loaded and simulated with a
`~zasim.zacformat.ZacSimulator` and its data can be displayed with a
`~zasim.zacformat.ZacConsoleDisplay`.
