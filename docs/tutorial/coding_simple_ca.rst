Programming simple CA interactively
===================================

zasim is, at heart, a package of useful utilities and parts and pieces to
experiment with cellular automata. For experimentation, an interactive
console is a good tool to find out what zasim offers and to experiment with
different step functions.

The package `zasim.cagen` offers a variety of pre-fabricated simulator
prototypes with interesting parameters you can tweak and the
`zasim.display` package offers a way to display each step of the simulator
on the console as ascii art.
