Programming simple CA interactively
===================================

zasim is, at heart, a package of useful utilities and parts and pieces to
experiment with cellular automata. For experimentation, an interactive
console is a good tool to find out what zasim offers and to experiment with
different step functions.

There is additional support for running zasim with the new `IPython`_
version 0.11 or higher, which offers a "rich" console and a web application
called "notebook". Using the ipython qtconsole, images from the cellular
automaton can be displayed directly inside the console as pictures, rather
than ascii art.

The package `zasim.cagen` offers a variety of pre-fabricated simulator
prototypes with interesting parameters you can tweak and the
`zasim.display` package offers a way to display each step of the simulator
on the console as ascii art - or as images when using the rich consoles
from IPython.
