:mod:`zasim.display` - Package for displaying configs
=====================================================

This package offers functionality to display the configs of simulators in
different formats. At the moment, only a Qt.QImage based rendering method
is supported and that only does configs with ones and zeros as values, but
in the future, palettes for different types of configs and renderers for
plaintext and html are going to be added.
