Welcome to zasim's documentation!
=================================

zasim is a python package for simulating and developing cellular automatons.

When in a more finished state, its main features will be:

  - Reduction of boilerplate code by using the :doc:`cagen <cagen>` module.
  - User interface tightly coupled with interactive console. Generate
    transscripts of sessions and re-play them.
  - Displaying one-dimensional and two-dimensional cellular automatons.
  - Show different types of histograms.
  - Compare different runs of cellular automatons.
  - Manipulate cellular space through UI or code.
  - It runs fast, but developing fast cellular automatons is simple.
